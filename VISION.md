### TrueGreen (working definition)
 TrueGreen is an operational sustainability system that helps businesses record real  activities, attach evidence, and generate trustworthy outputs for internal tracking and external reporting.

### What it does
 - Captures operational activities (energy, fuel, water, waste, packaging, travel)
 - Stores evidence (invoices, bills, logs)
 - Converts inputs into transparent metrics
 - Produces structured outputs (reports, CSVs)

### What it is not
 - Not an ESG rating platform
 - Not an EPR filing portal
 - Not a consulting narrative tool
 - ESG and EPR are outputs, not the core.
