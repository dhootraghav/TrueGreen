# TrueGreen
Operational sustainability for real businesses ~ From daily operations to trusted reports.

### Overview
TrueGreen is an early-stage project focused on continuous sustainability tracking for small and medium-sized businesses.
Instead of treating sustainability as a one-time reporting task, TrueGreen is designed around day-to-day operations — capturing real data, keeping it traceable, and turning it into clear sustainability insights and reporting-ready outputs when needed.

### Why TrueGreen?
Many existing sustainability and ESG tools are built for large enterprises and annual reporting cycles.
SMEs, however, operate with limited time, limited resources, and messy real-world data.
TrueGreen explores a simpler, operational approach that prioritises:
 - evidence over declarations
 - continuity over annual snapshots
 - clarity over complexity

### What this project focuses on?
 - Tracking energy, fuel, water, and waste using real business documents
 - Maintaining traceability from documents to calculated metrics
 - Basic verification to reduce misuse or manipulation
 - Simple views that reflect operational reality

### What’s in this repository?
This repository contains the design and early implementation of TrueGreen, including:
 - system and data model experiments
 - calculation and verification logic
